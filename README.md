Front-End technologies – HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT.JS are used.
Deployment of a project using FIREBASE

Technologies Used:
1.	HTML - It is used to structure and present information on web pages. It provides a standardized way to mark up content, making it accessible, well-organized, and easily understood by web browsers and search engine crawlers, allowing Google to index and display search results effectively.

2.	CSS - CSS is the primary technology for styling and formatting web pages. It allows developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of HTML elements.

3.	JavaScript - It is utilized in websites to perform dynamic tasks, such as fetching data from servers and executing actions in real-time, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the user experience.

4.	React - React simplifies UI development through reusable components and a declarative approach, optimizing performance with a virtual DOM.

5.	Firebase hosting – It is a web hosting service provided by Google Firebase, offering developers a simple and efficient way to deploy and host web applications, static content, and dynamic content.

Steps to create search engine:
•	To create a react app, the command “npx create-react-app google-clone” was employed.
•	I’ve developed a layout for the homepage and search results page of a Google search engine using HTML and CSS.
•	Developed essential components for the application, including SearchBar, SearchResults, and SearchResultItem.
•	I've crafted functional components for each UI element, ensuring modularity and well-commented code.
•	The responsiveness of the Google search engine has been accomplished through the use of CSS.
•	Routing is implemented using the react-router-dom library in React.



Context API
•	Context API in React is employed to efficiently manage and propagate data, such as API responses, throughout various components in a React application, providing a centralized and organized approach to handling and sharing this external data within the component tree.
•	Utilized the Search engine Id (CONTEXT_KEY) from https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new and API_KEY from https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key   to establish a Custom Search Engine (CSE) using Google Custom Search. This platform empowers users to craft a personalized search engine that is specifically designed for particular websites, subjects, or areas of interest.
•	Retrieved data using the Fetch API with the context API ID and app key and displayed in Google search result page.



















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
